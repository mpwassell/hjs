Parser
=======

Reporting of errors reports for top level construct - not very usefull
Revisit 'new new'

Rationalise parse tests around productions in parser

Review handling of whiteSpace (ie occurances of whiteSpace scattered throughout)

Review error handling and use of try - it seems that excessive use can block where real occurance of error occurs.but results, on first attempt, in more errors

Interpreter
============

Handling inbuilt arrays and Array object

DONE getValue should go up __proto__ chain
DONE Make this work
for 'new', setup newobject, set __proto__ to be prototype of constructor and set 'this' of the call to be the newobject

DONE Add a ObjId type so that it can be distinguished from Int


'constructor' property of the 'prototype' of a function is the function itself. ie 'this.prototype.constructor == this'
  

Interp - 
Think about if Rel needs to be a value
Add Object and Array to Value
Fix code for relops to work. Problem with LiftIt; add Bool to Value...


Add eval option to hjs; to evaluate an expression which can be a function call

Name moduels after the haskell ones and use same functions ...

If interested using pprint as well from Language.Haskell
